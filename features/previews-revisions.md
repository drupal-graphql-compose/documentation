# Previews & Revisions

> :fire: Enable the **graphql_compose_routes** module.

Load an entity revision and previews using the `route()` query and the `route_entity_extra` resolver.

## Previews

This URL is generated by Drupal. You will need to be logged in (via oauth or similar) as the user who initiated the preview, to view the preview.

```graphql
query {
  route(path: "/node/preview/316a57af-eb8d-4bc6-8347-7b35970780c8/full") {
    ... on RouteInternal {
      entity {
        ... on NodeArticle {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> :thinking: When you click "Preview" in the Drupal admin interface, it generates a preview URL with the entities UUID, and stores your entity in a private form state **for that user**. Maybe you could use the preview URL in an iframe or as a redirect on the Drupal admin interface?

> Check out the [GraphQL Compose: Preview](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql_compose_preview) companion module for tokenised previews.

## Revisions

This URL is generated by Drupal.

```graphql
query {
  route(path: "/node/2/revisions/2/view") {
    ... on RouteInternal {
      entity {
        ... on NodeArticle {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Entity loads also support the optional `revision` argument.

```graphql
query {
  node(id: 2, revision: 2) {
    ... on NodeArticle {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

> :thinking: You need to have the correct permissions to view the revision. You can use a string of 'latest' to get the latest revision, or a string of 'current' to get the current revision.
