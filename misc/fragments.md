# Fragments

Fragments can help your kick-start your GraphQL queries. We've provided an auto updating fragments list for your reference.

## Fragment suggestions

To enable fragment suggestions, download and enable the [graphql_compose_fragments](https://www.drupal.org/project/graphql_compose_fragments) module.

After installing and configuring, settings will be shown on the GraphQL Compose Fragment page.

- Visit GraphQL Compose &rarr; Fragments at `/admin/config/graphql_compose/fragments`
